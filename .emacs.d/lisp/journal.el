;; Get the time exactly 24 hours from now.  This produces three integers,
;; like the current-time function.  Each integers is 16 bits.  The first and second
;; together are the count of seconds since Jan 1, 1970.  When the second word
;; increments above 6535, it resets to zero and carries 1 to the high word.
;; The third integer is a count of milliseconds (on machines which can produce
;; this granularity).  The math in the defun below, then, is to accommodate the
;; way the current-time variable is structured.  That is, the number of seconds
;; in a day is 86400.  In effect, we add 65536 (= 1 in the high word) + 20864
;; to the current-time.  However, if 20864 is too big for the low word, if it
;; would create a sum larger than 65535, then we "add" 2 to the high word and
;; subtract 44672 from the low word.
