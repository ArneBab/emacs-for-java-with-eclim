Dumb Jump is an Emacs "jump to definition" package with support for multiple programming languages that favors
"just working" over speed or accuracy.  This means minimal -- and ideally zero -- configuration with absolutely
no stored indexes (TAGS) or persistent background processes.  Dumb Jump performs best with The Silver Searcher
`ag` or ripgrep `rg` installed.  Dumb Jump requires at least GNU Emacs 24.3.
